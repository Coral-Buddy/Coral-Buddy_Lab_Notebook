I am a PhD student for the [Cnidarian Immunity Lab](https://www.cnidimmunitylab.com/). My research focus is in coral stem cell biology. I am striving to understand how to precisely identify coral stem cells and the best mechanisms to transplant them and monitor the process.

I am dedicated to open, rigorous, and reproducible experiments and analyses.
